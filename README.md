Gold Price Time Series Prediction with LSTM and GRU Models Tsenguun Enkhbaatar

In this analysis, I use the LSTM and GRU Recurrent Neural Network models to predict the time-series data of the Gold Price. I show that by extracting the time trend from data, the Recurrent Neural Network models perform better. The time trend can be estimated from the training dataset. Furhter, this estimated time trend can be added back to the prediction on the test dataset after estimating the model on the training dataset.
